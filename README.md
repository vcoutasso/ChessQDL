# ChessQDL

Final project of the Data Structures 1 subject. Presented on 12/2019.

ChessQDL is a chess engine that uses a simple heuristic function to evaluate the current state of a given board and the minimax algorithm to choose a move within the tree of possible moves.

The engine was designed to allow for games of Player vs Engine and Player vs Player.

``` sh
$ ./bin/ChessQDL
```

Build Debug version:

``` sh
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
$ make
```

Note: Building in Debug mode will download Google Test from GitHub.

Run tests (Debug version only):

``` sh
$ ctest -V
```

As an alternative to Unix Makefiles, other generators such as Ninja can be used:
